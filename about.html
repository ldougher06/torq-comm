                            <small>CEO</small>
                        </h3>
                        <p>Paul Iannello has a long history in the field of Quality Control data collection. As a graduate Mechanical Engineer from the Rochester Institute of Technology, he started his career in Quality Control in 1986 with Quality Measurement Systems in Rochester, NY. After designing and building his own data collector called the SPC Sentry, his company was purchased by Verax Systems where he became their VP of Sales & Marketing, and board member. After four years of doubling sales, and a joint venture he structured with Dataputer, Verax was purchased by Moore Data Systems. Paul then became the Midwest Regional Sales Manager for GageTalker. With so many years in the data collection industry, Paul had the knowledge to deliver what the industry demanded and needed. Torq-Comm has been the byproduct of all this.</p>
