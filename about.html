                            <small>President/CEO</small>
                        </h3>
                        <p>Paul Iannello Sr has a long history in the field of Quality Control data collection. As a graduate Mechanical Engineer from the Rochester Institute of Technology, he started his career in Quality Control in 1986 with Quality Measurement Systems in Rochester, NY. After designing and building his own data collector called the SPC Sentry, his company was purchased by Verax Systems where he became their VP of Sales & Marketing and a board member. After four years of doubling sales, and a joint venture he structured with Dataputer of Manchester England, Verax was purchased by Moore Data Systems. Paul then became the Midwest Regional Sales Manager for GageTalker. With so many years in the data collection industry, Paul had the knowledge to deliver what the industry demanded and needed. Since 2004, I & R Partners has been the byproduct of all this.</p>

                        <p>Jarvis Stubblefield started in the information technology industry in 1998 by first building PC's and working through software design and engineering.

Many of the unique features found in the GaugeFlex lineup of data collection products were invented by Jarvis due to his vast knowledge of innovative technologies. His ability to apply this knowledge to the challenges I & R Partners and their customers have faced, is why he was offered the COO position in 2010.</p>
